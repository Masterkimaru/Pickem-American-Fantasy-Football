🏈 Pickem American Fantasy Football

A cross-platform (iOS & Android) fantasy NFL football app built with React Native.
Unlike traditional fantasy apps where players draft rosters, Pickem uses a simplified but competitive format:

👉 Each week, users pick teams they believe will win in real NFL games. Points are awarded based on correct picks, and users compete inside leagues and matchups.

This app brings the thrill of fantasy football to casual and competitive fans alike, without the complexity of managing full rosters.

🎮 Gameplay Overview
